Some python programs I've wrote for my intro to gaming course.
racingCar.py is an animation of two cars racing, use the arrow keys to speed-up, slow-down, pause and resume.
windMill.py is an animation of a wind mill. Use the buttons to control the speed, pause and resume the wind mill.
fractalRectangle is an animation of drawing using recursive function.
